        -Implemented a DAOFactory. It now works with the UserDBTable so far Hope to get it working with the rest of the DAO's tonight.
            -In a perfect world I would have time to remove the JDBC, and just have one class extend DAOFactory, but we probably won't get there 
        -Fixed all the tests for the DAO's excluding the FloorDAO
            -something is still wrong with the floor constructor
            -we still need to figure out how we are storing images.
        -Minor updates to MeetingSpaceDAO
            -issue: when something is added to the DB, the instance variable for the dao is not updated with the new item.
        -Minor updates to MeetingDAO
